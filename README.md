# MetaP3FixerUpper
Tool to analyze, alter and customize the metadata of your music collection.

Those who collect digital media generally collect digital media from the internet. These individuals are known as ~~pirates~~ collectors. Not all ~~pirates~~ collectors are the same, and thus the organization of said media may not be one-size-fits-all. As a ~~pirate~~ collector, I have many such artifacts in which the organization is what I would consider...sub-par. As a collection grows, the task of fixing it up becomes more daunting. Some might see to these errors as they add to their collection; I am not one such individual. My collection is now of a size that shrivels my ambition to clean it down to microscopic levels. Thankfully, we have tools for automation.

It is well known that [pirates are an unimaginative lot when it comes to naming things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHe8lS0Huo). Luckily, I'm not a pirate — simply a collector — hence the clever name.

This is a tool that is meant to solve the problems outlined below. If you have caught yourself thinking any of the following, then this tool might be for you:

* Other MP3 metadata editors are cumbersome
* Other MP3 metadata editors keep renaming my Kashiwa Daisuke tracks to "これは何と言ってるの？"
* Other MP3 metadata editors don't give me enough control over the process
* Other MP3 metadata editors have unimaginative names
